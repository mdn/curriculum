# Getting started modules

The subjects outlined in these modules are not web development topics, but they are useful for anyone wanting to learn front-end web development to have an understanding of. We don't consider learning these topics as required before moving on to the core modules, hence we haven't used the word "prerequisite". However, we believe students will have an easier time if they spend some time on these topics first.
