# Extension 9 Other tooling types

> **Notes**:
>
> - This set of criteria doesn't require having an in-depth knowledge of the tools listed below; instead, students are encouraged to learn the basic concepts of why and how they are used (and where in a web app project), test them out, and play with usage examples.

Learning outcomes — understand the purpose and basic usage of other common tooling types you may be required to use in a web project:

- Linters/formatters, for example, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/):

  - Detecting potential bugs, and how linters can automatically fix them.

  - The need to have coding standards, and how these tools can easily automate conformance to those standards.

  - Integrating them as part of your workflow — as a code editor extension, as part of your test runner, or as part of a CI run.

- Package managers, for example, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

  - Using these as a way to manage project dependencies as a codebase becomes more complex.

  - Finding suitable packages to solve your problems from registries and installing them.

  - Using scripts (for example npm scripts) to make deployment and testing easier.

- Build tools/bundlers, for example, [Rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), and [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/):

  - Using these to manage dependencies, and organize, optimize, and minify your code into build files for improved performance.

- Deployment tools, for example, Simple FTP clients, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/):

  - Using these to deploy your applications.

  - Integrating tooling with GitHub to provide automatic test deployments on push.

  - Handling custom domains, serverless functions, and form submissions.

  - Handling access control and integration with identity providers such as Okta and Auth0.

  - Integrations with popular frameworks and app platforms.
