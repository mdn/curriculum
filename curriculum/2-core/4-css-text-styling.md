## 4.3 Web fonts

- Using a web font with the `font-family` property.

- Other descriptors — `font-weight`, `font-style`, etc.

- Using an online service to find web fonts and generate web font code, for example, [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com) and [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

- Usability implications of web fonts — using several of them can increase page download size.
