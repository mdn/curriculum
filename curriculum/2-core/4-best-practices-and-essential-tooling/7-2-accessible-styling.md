- Color contrast.

  - Use an online tool such as WebAIM's [Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) or [TPGi Colour Contrast Analyzer](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/) to check whether your color contrast conforms to the relevant WCAG conformance criteria

  - Be mindful of those with color blindness or visual impairments; provide high-contrast modes to suit

- `:focus` and `:hover` styles.

  - These are important as cues for keyboard users

- Sensible animation usage â€” use animation subtly and provide controls to turn it off.

  - Consider the needs of those with certain cognitive disabilities
