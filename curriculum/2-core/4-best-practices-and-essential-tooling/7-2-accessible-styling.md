### 7.2 Accessible styling

Learning outcomes:

- Text sizing and layout.

  - Make sure your text is well laid out, consistent, and legible

  - Consider providing large-type interfaces for those with visual impairments

  - See also [4.1 Text and font styling](../2-styling/4-1-text-and-font-styling.md)

- Color contrast.

  - Use an online tool such as WebAIM's [Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) or [TPGi Colour Contrast Analyzer](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/) to check whether your color contrast conforms to the relevant WCAG conformance criteria

  - Be mindful of those with color blindness or visual impairments; provide high-contrast modes to suit

- `:focus` and `:hover` styles.

  - These are important as cues for keyboard users

  - See also [4.2 Styling lists and links](../2-styling/4-2-styling-lists-and-links.md)

- Sensible animation usage — use animation subtly and provide controls to turn it off.

  - Consider the needs of those with certain cognitive disabilities

  - The `prefers-reduced-motion` media query was created to help with this

- Good practices for hiding content so that it doesn't become inaccessible.

  - For example `display: none` makes content unreadable by screen readers. Use it carefully
