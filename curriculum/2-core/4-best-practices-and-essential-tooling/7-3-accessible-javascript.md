### 7.3 Accessible JavaScript

Learning outcomes:

- Understand that there is such a thing as too much JavaScript.

  - A simpler approach is usually more accessible, and often better for everyone

  - Source order is important to assistive technology. Using JavaScript to generate all your content on the fly can result in an inaccessible experience

- Understand the value of unobtrusive JavaScript.

  - If possible, use JavaScript as a usability enhancement, which isn't essential for the app to function

  - A good example is client-side validation of form inputs

- Be mindful of avoiding mouse-specific events that lock out keyboard or touch-screen users, for example, `mouseover`, `mouseout`, `dblclick`, and `hover`.

- Use touch/pointer events to handle alternative pointing devices and mobile interfaces.
