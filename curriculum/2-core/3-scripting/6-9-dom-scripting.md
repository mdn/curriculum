### 6.9 DOM scripting

Learning outcomes:

- Understand what the DOM is — the browser's internal representation of the document's HTML structure as a hierarchy of objects, which can be manipulated using JavaScript.

- Understand the important parts of a web browser and how they are represented in JavaScript — `Navigator`, `Window`, `Document`.

- Understand how DOM nodes exist relative to each other in the DOM tree — root, parent, child, sibling, descendant.

- Getting references to DOM nodes, for example with `querySelector()` and `getElementById()`.

- Creating new nodes, for example with `createElement()` and `createTextNode()`.

- Adding and removing nodes to the DOM with `appendChild()` and `removeChild()`.

- Adding attributes with `setAttribute()`.

- Manipulating styles with `Element.style.*` and `Element.classList.*`.
