### 6.6 Loops

Learning outcomes:

- Understand the purpose of loops â€” you want to do something very similar many times and don't want to have to repeat the same code every time.

- Basic `for` loops.

- Looping through collections with `for ... of`.

  - Understand that array methods such as `forEach()`, `map()`, and `filter()` are types of loop.

- `break` and `continue`.

- `while` and `do ... while` loops.

> **Notes:**
>
> - There are many other types of loop in JavaScript that we haven't listed here. It is not necessary (or useful) to understand all of them at this stage. For now, students just need to understand the purpose of loops, and the most common types.
