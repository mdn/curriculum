### 6.11 Asynchronous JavaScript fundamentals

Learning outcomes:

- Understand the concept of asynchronous JavaScript â€” what it is and how it differs from synchronous JavaScript

- Understand that callbacks and events have historically provided the means to do asynchronous programming in JavaScript

- Modern asynchronous programming with async functions and `await`

  - Basic usage

  - Understanding async function return values

  - Error handling with `try`/`catch`

- Promises

  - Understand that `async`/`await` use promises under the hood; they provide a simpler abstraction

  - Chaining promises

  - Catching errors

  - `all()`, `any()`, `finally()`

  - Understand the cases in which you'd still use promises rather than `async`/`await`
