### 2.6 Media

Learning outcomes:

- The term "replaced element" — what does it mean?

- Images, audio, video

  - The basics — `<img>`, `<audio>`, and `<video>` tags

  - Using `src` to point to a resource (Paths are also important here; see [2.5 Links](./2-5-links.md))

  - Using `width` and `height`, for example, to avoid unpleasant jerky updates to the UI once an image has finished loading and is displayed

  - Best practice uses of `title`

  - `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`

  - Video and audio-specific attributes such as `controls` and `muted`

  - `<sources>`

  - Optimizing images for the web; keep file sizes small

- Media assets and licensing

  - Different types of licensing — public domain/CC0, permissive (e.g. CC license, MIT), copyrighted (rights-managed/royalty-free)

  - Searching for appropriately-licensed media files to use in projects using search engines (e.g. [Google Images](https://images.google.co.uk/)) and specific media repositories (e.g. [Flickr,](https://www.flickr.com/) [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/))

  - Complying with license requirements.

- Canvas

  - Understanding what `<canvas>` is — a scriptable, updateable image

  - `width` and `height`

- `<picture>` and `srcset` for responsive images

- Alternative text for media

  - Alt text for images and video

> **Notes:**
>
> - It is not necessary to understand how to script a `<canvas>` element at this stage. That requires JavaScript APIs, and is covered in [Extension 3.2 Graphics/animation APIs](../../3-extensions/3-web-apis.md#32-graphicsanimation-apis).
