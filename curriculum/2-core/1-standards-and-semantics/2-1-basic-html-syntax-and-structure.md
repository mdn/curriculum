- The HTML head, and its purpose as a metadata container for the document including key uses

  - Setting information like character encoding and title.

  - Providing metadata for search engines and social media platforms, and the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) benefits.

  - Linking to icons for use on browsers and mobile platforms.

  - Linking to stylesheets and script files.

- The HTML body and its purpose as a container for the page content.

- The anatomy of an HTML element — element, opening tag, content, closing tag, attributes.

- What [void elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Void_element) (also known as empty elements) are and how they differ from standard elements.

- Replaced elements, and their purpose — they act as containers into which external content (such as images and video) is embedded.
