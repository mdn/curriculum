### 2.4 Advanced text techniques

Learning outcomes:

- Correct usage of elements for emphasis and importance, such as `<strong>` and `<em>`

<!-- -->

- Understand that HTML elements exist for representing other less common semantic requirements, for example:

  - Quotations

  - Abbreviations and acronyms

  - Addresses

  - Times and dates

  - Superscript and subscript

  - HTML entities

  - Other text markup features such as `<u>`, `<s>`, and `<ruby>`

<!-- -->

- Understand fundamental web copy best practices. For example:

  - Ideal body copy length for readability is somewhere between 50-75 characters

  - Favor simple prose where possible; there is no benefit to making the language structure complex just because the topic is complex.

  - Don't use idioms or slang in your writing, as they make text harder to understand for an international audience, and harder to translate.

  - Long sentences and long paragraphs make copy difficult to read. Break them up.
