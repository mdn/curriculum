### 2.4 Advanced text techniques

Learning outcomes:

- Correct usage of elements for emphasis and importance, such as `<strong>` and `<em>`

<!-- -->

- Understand that HTML elements exist for representing other less common semantic requirements, for example:

  - Quotations

  - Abbreviations and acronyms

  - Addresses

  - Times and dates

  - Superscript and subscript

  - HTML entities

  - Other text markup features such as `<u>`, `<s>`, and `<ruby>`

<!-- -->

- Understand fundamental web copy best practices. For example:

  - Ideal body copy length for readability is somewhere between 50-75 characters

  - Favor simple prose where possible; there is no benefit to making the language structure complex just because the topic is complex.

  - Don't use idioms or slang in your writing, as they make text harder to understand for an international audience, and harder to translate.

  - Long sentences and long paragraphs make copy difficult to read. Break them up.

> - It is not necessary to have an exhaustive understanding of all the semantic elements HTML offers at this stage, but you should understand that they exist, and how to look them up using MDN if you need them.
