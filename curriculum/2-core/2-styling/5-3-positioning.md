### 5.3 Positioning

Learning outcomes:

- Understand the behavior of default — static — positioning

- Relative positioning

  - Understand that relatively positioned elements remain in the normal flow

  - Final layout position can be modified using the top, bottom, left, and right

    - Or logical equivalents such as inline-block-start, inline-block-end, etc.

  - The inset shorthand

- Absolute positioning

  - Absolute (and fixed/sticky) positioning takes elements completely out of the normal flow to sit in their own separate layer

  - top, bottom, left, right, and inset have different effects on absolutely-positioned elements than on relatively-positioned ones

  - Setting the positioning context of a positioned element by positioning an ancestor element

- Fixed and sticky positioning

  - Understand how these differ from absolute positioning

- Understand what the stacking context is, and how to control z-axis position of positioned elements with z-index
