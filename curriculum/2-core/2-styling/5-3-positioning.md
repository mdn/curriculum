### 5.3 Positioning

Learning outcomes:

- Understand the behavior of default — `static` — positioning

- Relative positioning

  - Understand that relatively-positioned elements remain in the normal flow

  - Final layout position can be modified using the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` properties

    - Or logical equivalents such as `inline-block-start`, `inline-block-end`, etc.

  - The `inset` shorthand

- Absolute positioning

  - Absolute (and fixed/sticky) positioning takes elements completely out of the normal flow to sit in a separate layer

  - `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and `inset` have different effects on absolutely-positioned elements than on relatively-positioned ones

  - Setting the positioning context of a positioned element by positioning an ancestor element

- Fixed and sticky positioning

  - Understand how these differ from absolute positioning

- Understand what the stacking context is, and how to control z-axis position of positioned elements with `z-index`
