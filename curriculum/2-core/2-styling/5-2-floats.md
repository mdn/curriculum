Learning outcomes:

- Understand the purpose of floats â€” for floating images inside columns of text, or possibly other fun techniques like drop caps and floating inset information boxes.

- Using the `float` property to create floats.

- Clearing floats using `clear`, and the `display: flow-root` value.
