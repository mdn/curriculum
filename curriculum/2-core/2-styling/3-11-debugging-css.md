### 3.11 Debugging CSS

Learning outcomes:

- Use the [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to see if you have any invalid markup on your page — this could be causing your CSS to not apply as desired.

- Use the [CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check for badly-formed CSS code. A missing semi-colon can cause a whole section of CSS declarations to not apply.

- Use browser developer tools to inspect the CSS that is applied to HTML elements on a page.

- Modify the applied CSS — enable and disable declarations, modify values, add new declarations — to figure out what changes are needed to get what you want.

- Use layout inspection tools to inspect the box model, grids, flexbox, and other layout features (see also [5 CSS Layout](./5-0-css-layout.md)).

- Use responsive design mode tools to check responsive layouts (see also [5.5 Responsive design specifics](./5-5-responsive-design-specifics.md)).
